                    <h1>White Chocolate Raspberry Cake</h1>
                    <p>
•	        Total Time: 65 minutes
A vanilla cake with white chocolate pudding & white chocolate chips mixed into the batter then swirled with raspberry filling and topped with a cream cheese frosting! This White Chocolate Raspberry Cake will become a favorite! ♡
Cake:
•	1 pkg. vanilla or french vanilla cake mix (I use Betty Crocker)
•	1 pkg. (3.3 oz) instant white chocolate pudding
•	1 cup sour cream
•	4 large eggs
•	1/2 cup milk 
•	3/4 cup oil
•	1 teaspoon vanilla
•	1 1/4 cups white chocolate chips, roughly chopped (measure, then chop)
•	1/2 to 2/3 cup raspberry pastry or pie filling (seedless raspberry jam works too)
Frosting:
•	1 pkg. (8 oz) cream cheese, softened
•	1/4 cup butter, softened
•	3–4 cups powdered sugar (depending on how sweet you want it)
•	2 teaspoons vanilla extract
INSTRUCTIONS
Cake:
1.	Grease and flour a bundt pan and preheat your oven to 325 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, combine cake mix, dry pudding mix, sour cream, eggs, milk, oil and vanilla. Mix until well combined, stir in white chocolate chips.
2.	Fill prepared bundt pan with one third of the batter. Spoon half of the raspberry filling in separated spoonfuls over the batter. Use a knife to swirl the filling through the cake. (just a few swirls), only about 6-7 light swirls. Pour another 1/3 of the batter in evenly and spoon in remaining pie filling, repeating the “swirling” process above. Top with remaining batter. (*SEE NOTES)
3.	Bake for 50 to 60 mins or until a knife or cake tester inserted comes out clean. Remove from oven. Let cool for 15-20 mins. Remove from pan.
Frosting:
1.	In a medium bowl, cream together the cream cheese and butter until creamy. Add the vanilla and powdered sugar, beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy.
2.	Spread cream cheese frosting evenly over cake. Or to get the look of Nothing Bundt Cakes, pipe on frosting starting at the bottom outside of the cake and moving upward towards center.

Total Time 50 minutes
Ingredients
Cake Ingredients
•	2.25 oz Dutch cocoa powder
•	8 oz water
•	3 large eggs
•	2 teaspoon vanilla extract
•	4 oz Mayonaise
•	14 oz Unbleached cake flour
•	15 oz granulated sugar
•	2 teaspoon baking powder
•	1 tsp baking soda
•	1 teaspoon salt
•	6 oz unsalted butter at room temperature
Chocolate Buttercream
•	8 oz pasteurized egg whites room temperature
•	32 oz powdered sugar
•	36 oz unsalted butter room temperature
•	1 tablespoon vanilla extract
•	1 tsp salt
•	4 oz cocoa powder
Instructions
Cake Instructions
1.	Bring the water to a boil. Add in cocoa powder.
Whisk until smooth then add in cold mayonnaise, vanilla and eggs. Whisk to break up the eggs. 
2.	Weigh out all dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt) and place into a stand mixer bowl and attach the paddle attachment.
3.	Turn mixer on low (setting 1 on Kitchen Aid mixers). Add in your room temperature butter in small chunks. Combine on low until you achieve a sandy mixture.
4.	Add ½ of your liquid ingredients into your dry ingredients and mix on medium for 2 minutes. If you do not do this step, your cake could collapse.
5.	Turn your mixer back down to low and add in the rest of your liquids slowly. Stop once or twice to scrape the bowl as needed.
Once they are all combined, turn back up to medium for another 30 seconds.
6.	Lightly grease two 8" round cake pans prepared with your choice of pan release. I prefer cake goop. 
7.	Bake for 30 minutes at 350ºF depending on how big your pans are. The bigger the pan, the longer it will take for them to bake. 
When a toothpick comes out of the center with a few sticky crumbs on it, the cake is done.
8.	After the cakes have cooled for about 10 minutes, or the pans have cooled to the point they can be touched, flip the cakes over and remove from the pans onto a cooling rack to cool completely. I cover mine in plastic wrap to keep them from drying out why they cool.
9.	Once the cakes are completely cool you can trim them and frost them.  
Chocolate Buttercream Instructions
1.	Place egg whites, powdered sugar in a stand mixer bowl.
Attach the whisk and combine ingredients on low and then whip on high for 5 minutes.
Reserve 8 oz of your butter and melt in microwave until JUST melted, don't over heat. 
Combine melted butter with cocoa powder and mix until smooth
Add in butter in small chunks and continue whipping until the mixture is light and white and creamy. Give it a taste, if it still tastes buttery then keep whipping.
Add in chocolate mixture, vanilla and salt and continue whipping until mixture is combined. Scrape bowl if needed. 
Remove the whisk and place the paddle attachment onto the mixer. Let your buttercream mix on low until the mixture is smooth and creamy and there are no bubbles left. This can take up to 20 minutes
Notes
This recipe works great for carving sculpted cakes! I use the same recipe for wedding and sculpted. I always bake them, de-pan them, wrap them in plastic wrap and then chill in the fridge or freezer (depending on how much of a rush I’m in) and then carve. Chilled cakes make carving or stacking SO much easier!
